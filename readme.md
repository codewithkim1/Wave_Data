# Pulse Signal and Continuous Sound Generator in Python

This code generates a pulse signal and a continuous sound using the `numpy` and `matplotlib` libraries in Python. The generated sound can be exported as a `.wav` file.

## Prerequisites

You will need the following packages installed in order to run this code:

- numpy
- matplotlib
- wave
- struct

You can install these packages using the following command:


## Function Descriptions

```python
def create_pulse_signal(duration, start_frequency, end_frequency):
    # Function to generate a pulse signal
    # ...

def create_continuous_sound(pulse_signal, delay):
    # Function to generate a continuous sound from a pulse signal
    # ...

def export_data(signal, file_name):
    # Function to export a signal as a .wav file
    # ...
```

## Usage

- Import the necessary modules:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import wave
import struct

```

## Signal Functions

- Define the create_pulse_signal function which generates a pulse signal with a specified duration and start/end frequency:

```python
def create_pulse_signal(duration, start_frequency, end_frequency):
    sample_rate = 44100
    t = np.linspace(0, duration, int(duration * sample_rate), False)
    frequencies = np.linspace(start_frequency, end_frequency, len(t))
    signal = 0.5 * np.sin(2 * np.pi * frequencies * t)
    return signal


```

The default values in the code generate a pulse signal with a duration of 0.001 seconds, start frequency of 16000 Hz and end frequency of 22000 Hz. The continuous signal is generated with a delay of 0.05 seconds between each pulse signal. The exported .wav file is named continuous_sound.wav. You can modify these values according to your needs.
